Hard Accuracy: 21.5% Submissions: 4384 Points: 8
Given a positive integer N. You have to find Nth natural number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9 .


Example 1:
 

Input:
N = 8
Output:
8
Explanation:
After removing natural numbers which contains
digit 9, first 8 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
and 8th number is 8.
 

Example 2:
 

Input:
N = 9
Output:
10
Explanation:
After removing natural numbers which contains
digit 9, first 9 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10
and 9th number is 10.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function findNth() which accepts an integer N as input parameter and return the Nth number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9.

Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1012


class Solution:
    def findNth(self,N):
        #code here
        a1=''
        while(N!=0):
            a1+=str(N%9)
            N=N//9
        return a1[::-1]
